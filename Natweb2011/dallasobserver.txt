THREE ARTISTS X THREE DECADES

"It's difficult to believe that 500X Gallery of Dallas, TX is 33 years old. The Exposition Park arts venue has hung in through trends and trials and remained a vibrant hub of local work, never seeming to age - save for twhatever the art gallery equivalnet of a little distinguished gray around the temples might be. In celebrration, Leslie Murrell has curated Imprents: Three Generations of 500X.      . . . Natalie Macellaio, who mimics on the wall the gallery's own cracks in the floor, but in precious silve. She's taken the old or the worn and made it new and more beautiful - because it's not that it wasn't already. Trying to honor a certain time is often kitschy in a time-capsule way, but Murrell and her three artists have skillfully exposed the imprints they'ver contributed to 500X, and that 500X has made on them... and us."
